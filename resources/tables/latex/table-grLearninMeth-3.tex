    The authors extend the standard co-training learning method. In order to increase the variety of feature sets for classification, they transform a document using three different document representation methods. 
    \\  
    \specialcell{Findings} & 
    The proposed multi-co-training (MCT) method achieves superior classification performance, even when the documents are transformed into a very-low-dimensional vector and the labelled documents are very few.
	\\  
	\specialcell{Challenges} & 
	Different scenarios of class imbalance should be explored. The computational complexity should be improved.

    \specialcell{Details} &
    The authors propose a new self-training solution, known as Self-Training with Latent Dirichlet Allocation (ST-LDA), which utilizes inductive learning in which evaluation is conducted on a validation set. 
    \\  
    \specialcell{Findings} & 
    Only a few instances in the early training stage caused the model to be over-fitted. ST-LDA requires a minimal amount of training labelled data to outperform other models.
    \\  
    \specialcell{Challenges} & 
    A better initial labeled set should be established. The computation time required should also be reduced.

    \specialcell{Details} &
    The authors propose an approach that explicitly considers the intrinsic manifold structure of data. 
    \\  
    \specialcell{Findings} & 
    The authors suggest combining the methods that select the most uncertain data points, and those that select the most representative points. 
    \\  
    \specialcell{Challenges} & 
    The computational complexity should be improved.
