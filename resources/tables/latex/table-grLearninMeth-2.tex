    The authors extend the standard co-training learning method where in order to increase the variety of feature sets for classification, they transform a document using three different document representation methods. 
    \\  
    \specialcell{Findings} & 
    The proposed multi-co-training (MCT) method achieve a superior classification performance even when documents are transformed into a very-low-dimensional vector and the labelled documents are very few.
	\\  
	\specialcell{Challenges} & 
	Different scenarios of class imbalance should be explored. The computational complexity should be improved.

    \specialcell{Details} &
    The authors propose a new self-training solution called Self-Training with Latent Dirichlet Allocation (ST LDA) utilises inductive learning, where the evaluation is carried out on a validation set. 
    \\  
    \specialcell{Findings} & 
    Only a few instances in the early training stage cause the model may be over-fitted. ST LDA requires a minimal amount of training labelled data to out-perform other models.
    \\  
    \specialcell{Challenges} & 
    A better initial labelled set should be established. Also, the computation time should be reduced.

    \specialcell{Details} &
    The authors proposed an approach that explicitly takes into account the intrinsic manifold structure of data. 
    \\  
    \specialcell{Findings} & 
    The authors suggested to combine the methods which select the most uncertain data points and  the methods which select the most representative points. 
    \\  
    \specialcell{Challenges} & 
    The computational complexity should be improved.
