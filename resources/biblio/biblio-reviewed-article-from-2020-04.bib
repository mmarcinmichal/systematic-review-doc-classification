  abstract  = {Constructing a graph with graph convolutional network (GCN)  to explore the relational structure of the data has attracted lots of interests in various tasks. However, for document classification, existing graph based methods often focus on the straightforward word-word and word-document relations, ignoring the hierarchical semantics. Besides, the graph construction is often independent from the task-specific GCN learning. To address these constrains, we integrate a probabilistic deep topic model into graph construction, and propose a novel trainable hierarchical topic graph (HTG), including word-level, hierarchical topic-level and document-level nodes, exhibiting semantic variation from fine-grained to coarse. Regarding the document classification as a document-node label generation task, HTG can be dynamically evolved with GCN by performing variational inference, which leads to an end-to-end document classification method, named dynamic HTG (DHTG). Besides achieving state-of-the-art classification results, our model learns an interpretable document graph with meaningful node embeddings and semantic edges.},

  abstract  = {One-hot CNN (convolutional neural network) has been shown to be effective for text categorization (Johnson &amp; Zhang, 2015a;b). We view it as a special case of a general framework which jointly trains a linear model with a non-linear feature generator consisting of 'text region embedding + pooling'. Under this framework, we explore a more sophisticated region embedding method using Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM). LSTM can embed text regions of variable (and possibly large) sizes, whereas the region size needs to be fixed in a CNN. We seek effective and efficient use of LSTM for this purpose in the supervised and semi-supervised settings. The best results were obtained by combining region embeddings in the form of LSTM and convolution layers trained on unlabeled data. The results indicate that on this task, embeddings of text regions, which can convey complex concepts, are more useful than embeddings of single words in isolation. We report performances exceeding the previous best results on four benchmark datasets.},
